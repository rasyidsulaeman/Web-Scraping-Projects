# MyAnimeList Scraping Project 

> This project is intended as a source of learning about web scaping from website. 

I am using `python` and `Beautiful Soup` package to grab the information from the website. 

The code is working by entering specific **anime genre** that we want to pull the information from and returning the **Anime Title**, **Year Aired**, **Rating**, **Status**, **Number of Episode**, **Genre**, **Source** and saving it to the `csv file`.

This is an example of the data looked like:

| Anime Title | Year Aired | Rating | Status | #of Epsiode | Genre | Source |
| ----------- | ---------- | -----  | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ------ |
|Sword Art Online |	2012 | 7.2 | Finished | 25 | ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Romance'] | Light novel |
| Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso |	2014 | 8.64 | Finished | 22	| ['Drama', 'Romance'] | Manga |


The code can be developed more. This is the list that I think can improve the project

- Create a object oriented programming to the code
- Automation bots using `selenium`
- Expand the variable on the table to get other usefull insight
